## Bruteforcing CMS users' passwords via the XMLRPC interface.
This script is a PoC for the "Brute Force Amplification Attack" exploit against XMLRPC interfaces enabling the *system.multicall()* method (enabled by default). 

The *system.multicall()* method allows multiple calls to be sent within a single HTTP request. Using this "wrapper", malicious attackers can carry out a large number of login attempts (bruteforce) with a minimal network impact, consequently making them stealthier and more efficient.

At the moment, the maximum number of calls which can be encapsulated within the *system.multicall()* method without triggering a networking error is 1999 calls meaning that for each HTTP request sent 1999 different login attempts are performed.

## Vulnerable CMS 
Script sucessfully tested against WordPress versions **< 4.4**

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AresS31/xmlrpc-bruteforcer
$ cd xmlrpc-bruteforcer
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Docker
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AresS31/xmlrpc-bruteforcer && cd xmlrpc-bruteforcer
$ docker build -t xmlrpc-bruteforcer .
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/wordlists xmlrpc-bruteforcer -u admin -w /wordlists/wordlist.txt -t 3 -x https://wordpress.local/xmlrpc.php
```

## Usage
```
$ python3 xmlrpc-bruteforcer.py -u [username] -w [wordlist] -x [xmlrpc_intf] -t [threads_number] -c [chunks_size] -v [verbose] -h [help]
[-u]: username of the targeted user, required
[-w]: wordlist containing the passwords to try, required
[-x]: xmlrpc interface to attack, required
[-t]: number of threads to run, optional, default value: 5 
[-c]: number of calls to encapsulate within a system.mullticall() call, optional, default value: 1999
[-v]: print debugging information, optional, default value: False
[-h]: print help
```
